## How to Play Blackjack

1. **Objective:**
   - Beat the dealer by getting a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.

2. **Game Play:**
   - You start with two cards, and the dealer shows one card.
   - Choose **Hit** to receive another card or **Stand** to keep your current hand.
   - Continue to **Hit** until you decide to **Stand** or exceed 21.
   - The dealer must hit until their hand value is at least 17.

3. **Special Rules:**
   - Aces can count as either 1 or 11.
   - Blackjack (an Ace with a 10-value card) wins automatically unless the dealer also has blackjack.
